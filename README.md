# 🎨 MGB Canvas Engine

The **MGB Canvas Engine** is a beginner-friendly and powerful tool for building interactive experiences using HTML5 Canvas — just like Scratch, but with real code!

---

## 💡 What Is It?

The MGB Canvas Engine makes it super easy to move and control objects on the HTML5 canvas. You can create sprites, animate them, and build simple games or simulations — all with a structure that feels as intuitive as Scratch, but coded in JavaScript.

Whether you're a beginner or a hobbyist, this engine helps you bring your creative ideas to life on the web.
